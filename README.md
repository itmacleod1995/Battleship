Battleship

Python console program that simulates the popular Battleship board game. The player's board is read in from a file, while the computer's board is generated randomly from a predefined set of coordinates for each ship. The player and computer take turns firing at each other. When either the player or computer shoots down the other's ships, they are the winner!
